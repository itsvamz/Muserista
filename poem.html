            Running as fast as a tiger;<br>
            Burning in huge flames of her own fire.<br>
            Chasing her dreams like a cat after a mouse;<br>
            Surpassing every hurdle with a lion’s pounce.<br>
            <br><br>
            A crown always being adorned on her head;<br>
            Her smile stays even after her failures append.<br>
            Never noticed a single tear sliding down her eyes;<br>
            The depth in those orbs have multiple stories that shine.<br>
            <br><br>
            Taking a hault from her sprint;<br>
            She breathes, breathes and breathes.<br>
            Reflecting on her journey so far;<br>
            A contented sigh is all she releases.<br>
            <br><br>
            Remembering about her long way ahead;<br>
            Bringing a lovely smile back on her face.<br>
            Coming back to the position of a head-set;<br>
            She again gets on the race.<br>

            Results are important<br>
But what’s more is the process.<br>
Beneath a pile of wet tissues<br>
And a face of red swollen eyes;<br>
Resides a chapter of some beautiful issues<br>
Written with blood, sweat and sacrifice.<br>
<br><br>
Not all parts of a novel<br>
Are supposed to be smiles;<br>
The great things to be achieved<br>
Are bound to take miles.<br>
<br><br>
Taking notes from behind<br>
In hope to let the mistakes go;<br>
This issue shall be forgiven<br>
In order to proceed the show.<br>
<br><br>
Advancing towards the next part of the book<br>
With an owe to never let the smile go;<br>
Leaving out all the tears off the hook<br>
A precious memory of success is to be adored.<br>
<br><br>
Individuality being the first trait<br>
Starting the journey with no hate;<br>
All set to rejoice the upcoming adventures<br>
I hereby welcome another beautiful disaster.<br>

            Sailing in a boat in an empty sea<br>
She rows the water with such glee;<br>
Looking at the sun in an empty sky<br>
She assures herself of the upcoming high.<br>
<br><br>
Hopeful of the future adventures<br>
Looking forward for all the ventures;<br>
She waits for it all to keep getting better<br>
Tho the time to come seems as bland as the weather.<br>
<br><br>
The boat in her command<br>
Is sailing in the sea;<br>
With herself as the captain<br>
She enjoys the journey with a tea.<br>
<br><br>
She searched long for a company to join her boat;<br>
Tho the people were too busy admiring the shore.<br>
The journey to them was an impossible amore;<br>
The trip to beyond was then her solo explore.<br>
<br><br>
A beautiful smile on her face will always linger;<br>
A passion to learn already made her a thinker.<br>
Maybe she would just be a solo explorer;<br>
But her journey would be worthwhile for a journal.<br>

There lives a little sassy girl.<br>
Having wild imaginations and curiosity enwhirled;<br>
Taking cautious steps, she crosses every hurdle.<br>
<br><br>
Yes, she falls and breaks a million times;<br>
But pop herself up every single while.<br>
She smell the cherry even in a field of limes;<br>
Arming herself up with a gun, she smiles and smiles and smiles.<br>
<br><br>
Everyone watches her with fire red eyes;<br>
She gives them a wink and chilli to get the spice.<br>
She sings and dances raising her hand up for some high fives;<br>
She runs after every trophy like a cat chasing a mice.<br>
<br><br>
Yes, she get to see a million lies that make her torn;<br>
But she smashes them up and go on with her drives.<br>
Dancing in a field of roses, she dodge every thorn;<br>
Like a Queen who doesn’t need a King for her thrown, she smiles and smiles and smiles.<br>
